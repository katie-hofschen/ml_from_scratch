    "# Naive Bayes\n",
    "Is a supervised learning algorithm based on applying Bayes’ theorem with the “naive” assumption of conditional independence between every pair of features given the value of the class variable.\n",

    "\n",
    "They work quite well, can be very fast and require a small amount of training data to estimate the necessary parameters. They have been famously used in document classification and spam filtering. However, it is known to be a bad estimator, so the probability outputs from are not to be taken too seriously.\n",
