## About The Project

This repository of machine learning methods from scractch is a small revision of some basic algorithms and how to implement them with numpy. At the beginning of each file you will find explanations and descriptions of how the algorithms work.

ML algorithms implemented so far:
* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Naive Bayes
* Perceptron
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Decision Trees
* distance measures (euclidian, manhattan, chebyshev, etc.)
* activation functions (sigmoid, tanh, reLU, etc.)
* metrics to measure performance (RMSE, MAE, accuracy, etc.)
* In progress: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

This is a work in progress, so check back frequently for improved code and documentation.
